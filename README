DPDK has a distributed Continuous Integration (CI) system.

It is discussed in the mailing list ci@dpdk.org.


When are run the tests?
-----------------------

The tests can be run at any time:
- manually
- regularly to monitor a git tree
- after each patch submission to avoid accepting a bad patch


Where are run the tests?
------------------------

The tests can be run anywhere:
- in a private lab
- in a public/reference lab

There is no reference lab yet.


How to view CI results?
-----------------------

The test of a patch is viewable in patchwork (https://patches.dpdk.org)
if the report has been sent from a trusted lab.
The patchwork overview shows a counter column S/W/F for Success/Warning/Failure.
A bad performance can be seen as a failure.
More details are found in the detailed view of a patch.

Every test reports can be seen at http://dpdk.org/ml/archives/test-report/.

There is no summarized view of regular or manual tests yet.


How to add a CI report?
-----------------------

A test report can be sent to test-report@dpdk.org.
The sender must be trusted (whitelisted) by dpdk.org.

If a report has the format of a "per-patch" test,
it is automatically integrated in patchwork.
The script send-patch-report.sh should be used.

If a report has the same Test-Label and patchwork id as a prior report,
then it replaces the old one. It allows to re-run a test.


Scripts help
------------

Some scripts in this repository (dpdk-ci) may help to build a test.

Their purpose and options are described when using the option -h.


Scripts configuration
---------------------

Some scripts may need some configuration.

The file config/ci.config will be read if it is copied to /etc/dpdk/ci.config,
~/.config/dpdk/ci.config or .ciconfig in this directory.
The optional options can be uncommented to change the default values used in
the scripts.

The file pwclientrc must be copied in ~/.pwclientrc in order to access to
the XML-RPC interface of patchwork with the script pwclient.
